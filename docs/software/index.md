## Learn more about installing software on LUMI

On LUMI we support various ways to install software

 - [EasyBuild][easybuild] is our primary tool to manage the central software
   stack and we made it easy to install additional software in your home or
   project directory that extends that stack.
 - [Container wrapper][contwrapper] is a set of tools which wrap installations
   inside a Apptainer/Singularity container. These tools are recommended to 
   install Conda and pip packages on LUMI.
